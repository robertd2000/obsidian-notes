DROP TABLE is a SQL statement that permanently deletes a table and all its data from a database.

The syntax for the “DROP TABLE” statement is:

```
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

In this statement, table_name refers to the name of the table that you want to delete permanently from the database.

It’s important to note that the DROP TABLE statement is a powerful command that can have serious consequences if misused. Therefore, it should be used with caution and only when you are sure that you want to delete the table and all its data.
