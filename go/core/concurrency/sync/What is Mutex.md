During the development of [LiveAPI](https://liveapi.hexmos.com/), an Auto API documentation generation tool, I needed to implement a robust queue mechanism that scaled based on the number of server machine cores. This was crucial to prevent excessive resource usage (memory and CPU) that could lead to resource starvation, crashes, and a poor user experience.

In this article, I'll explain how I utilized mutexes in Golang to address this challenge.

**What is a Mutex?**  
In concurrent programming, a Mutex (Mutual Exclusion) is a locking mechanism that prevents race conditions by ensuring only one goroutine can access a shared resource at a time. It's akin to a key to a room – only one person can hold the key and enter at once.

**Mutex Usage in Golang**  
Let's illustrate how a Mutex can manage concurrent job execution:  
[Go's sync package](https://pkg.go.dev/sync) provides several primitives for synchronization, with Mutex being one of the most commonly used tools.  

```
var (
    maxConcurrentJobs int
    activeJobs        int
    jobMutex          sync.Mutex
)
```

In this code, the `activeJobs` variable tracks the number of currently running jobs. Since multiple goroutines might attempt to modify this variable concurrently, leading to race conditions, we use a Mutex to synchronize access.  

```
// Check if we can process more jobs
jobMutex.Lock()
if activeJobs >= maxConcurrentJobs {
    jobMutex.Unlock()
    // Wait before checking again
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    continue
}
jobMutex.Unlock()
```

**How a Mutex Works**  
_Locking_: The `Lock()` method acquires exclusive access to the critical section.

_Unlocking_: The `Unlock()` method releases the lock.

_Critical Section_: The code between `Lock` and `Unlock` where the **shared resource is accessed.

**Types of Mutexes in Golang**  
_sync.Mutex_: This is the basic mutual exclusion lock in Go. It allows only one goroutine to access the critical section at a time.  

```
type SafeCounter struct {
    mu    sync.Mutex
    count int
}
```

_sync.RWMutex_: This is a reader/writer mutex that allows multiple readers to access the shared resource simultaneously, but only one writer at a time.  

```
var rwMutex sync.RWMutex
// Reader methods
rwMutex.RLock()   // Lock for reading
rwMutex.RUnlock() // Unlock for reading

// Writer methods
rwMutex.Lock()    // Lock for writing
rwMutex.Unlock()  // Unlock for writing
```

Mutexes are essential tools for managing shared resources in concurrent Go programs. They prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity by controlling access to critical sections of code.
