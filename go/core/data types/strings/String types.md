A _string type_ represents the set of string values. A string value is a (possibly empty) sequence of bytes. The number of bytes is called the length of the string and is never negative. Strings are immutable: once created, it is impossible to change the contents of a string. The predeclared string type is `string`; it is a [defined type](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Type_definitions).

The length of a string `s` can be discovered using the built-in function [`len`](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Length_and_capacity). The length is a compile-time constant if the string is a constant. A string's bytes can be accessed by integer [indices](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Index_expressions) 0 through `len(s)-1`. It is illegal to take the address of such an element; if `s[i]` is the `i`'th byte of a string, `&s[i]` is invalid.
