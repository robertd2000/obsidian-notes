Methods are functions with receiver arguments, defined outside type declaration. Enable object-like behavior on types. Functions are standalone, methods belong to specific types. Methods can have value or pointer receivers. Both can accept parameters and return values.

Go does not have classes. However, you can define methods on types.
A method is a function with a special _receiver_ argument.
The receiver appears in its own argument list between the `func` keyword and the method name.
In this example, the `Abs` method has a receiver of type `Vertex` named `v`.

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	fmt.Println(v.Abs())
}

```

## Methods are functions

Remember: a method is just a function with a receiver argument.
Here's `Abs` written as a regular function with no change in functionality.

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func Abs(v Vertex) float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	fmt.Println(Abs(v))
}

```

## Methods continued

You can declare a method on non-struct types, too.

In this example we see a numeric type `MyFloat` with an `Abs` method.

You can only declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in the same package as the method. You cannot declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in another package (which includes the built-in types such as `int`).

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type MyFloat float64

func (f MyFloat) Abs() float64 {
	if f < 0 {
		return float64(-f)
	}
	return float64(f)
}

func main() {
	f := MyFloat(-math.Sqrt2)
	fmt.Println(f.Abs())
}

```
